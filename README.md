# AOA-Mini-Project
In this project, I have demonstrated the implementation and workings of Dijkstra's algorithm to compute the shortest path between a source node and a destination node in a weighted graph. We created a graph in the program's editor and defined the costs between the nodes. Then, we specified the source and destination nodes in the textbox and executed the algorithm to determine the path and cost between them.

To visualize the graph, we used HTML Canvas to draw circles representing the nodes and lines connecting them. We integrated the Canvas with JavaScript to implement the algorithm and compute the shortest path.

Through this project, we have gained a comprehensive understanding of Dijkstra's algorithm and its ability to efficiently determine the shortest path in a graph. This knowledge is highly relevant in several fields, such as transportation, networking, and computer science.
